# Coding workflow preferences
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes 
- Keep code simple and readable
- Write thorough tests for all functionalities you wrote
- Follow Solidity coding standards as defined in `solidity-coding-standards`

Follow this sequential workflow:
1. Write or update existing Solidity contracts following security best practices
2. Write the incremental unit-tests using Foundry to cover contract logic you wrote
3. Test that unit-tests pass with `forge test`
4. Verify it passes all existing tests by running `forge test` command
   - If updating relevant to a specific test you can use `forge test --match-test TEST_NAME_HERE`
5. Ensure your unit-tests have good code coverage for the code you have written with `forge coverage`
6. Consider gas optimization and run gas reports with `forge test --gas-report` for critical functions
