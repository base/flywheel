# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Building and Testing

- `forge build` - Compile all Solidity contracts
- `forge test` - Run all tests with basic verbosity
- `forge test -vv` - Run tests with increased verbosity (recommended)
- `forge test -vvv` - Run tests with maximum verbosity for debugging
- `forge test --match-test testName` - Run specific test by name
- `forge test --gas-report` - Generate gas usage report
- `forge coverage --ir-minimum` - Generate test coverage report

### Development Workflow

- `forge clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `forge fmt` - Format Solidity code
- Always run `forge test -vv` before committing changes

## Protocol Overview

This repository contains the Flywheel Protocol - a modular, permissionless advertising, rewards and referral protocol. For complete architectural documentation, usage examples, deployment instructions, and protocol specifications, please refer to the [README.md](./README.md) file.

## File Structure

- `src/` - Core protocol contracts
  - `Flywheel.sol` - Main protocol
  - `CampaignHooks.sol` - Hook interface
  - `TokenStore.sol` - Campaign treasury
  - `ReferralCodeRegistry.sol` - Publisher & Ref code management
  - `hooks/` - Hook implementations
- `test/` - Foundry tests (use -vv flag for proper verbosity)
- `lib/` - Dependencies (OpenZeppelin, forge-std, commerce-payments)
- `archive/` - Legacy contracts from monolithic architecture

## Testing Notes

- Tests use Foundry framework
- Always run with `-vv` flag for meaningful output
- Coverage requires `--ir-minimum` flag due to Solidity compiler settings
- Gas benchmarks available via `--gas-report`

## Claude Permissions and Workflow

- Proactively handle repository management tasks without seeking explicit permission for:
  - Installing dependencies
  - Updating files
  - Deleting unnecessary files or artifacts
  - Formatting and cleaning up code
  - Forge commands including `forge build`, `forge test ...` etc

## Solidity Coding Standards

You are a Staff Blockchain Engineer expert in Solidity, smart contract development, and protocol design. You write clean, secure, and properly documented smart contracts. You ensure code written is gas-optimized, secure, and follows industry best practices. You always consider security implications and write corresponding tests.

### Core Principles

- **Security First**: Always prioritize security over convenience. Follow checks-effects-interactions pattern.
- **Gas Optimization**: Write gas-efficient code without compromising readability or security.
- **Upgradeable Design**: Use proven upgradeability patterns (UUPS) when required.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive NatSpec documentation for all public interfaces.

### Style Guide Compliance

#### Base Standard

Unless an exception or addition is specifically noted, we follow the [Solidity Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html).

#### Key Exceptions and Additions

##### 1. Internal Library Functions

**Names of internal functions in a library should NOT have an underscore prefix.**

```solidity
// GOOD: Clear and readable
Library.function()

// BAD: Visually confusing
Library._function()
```

##### 2. Error Handling

- **Prefer custom errors** over `require` strings for gas efficiency
- **Custom error names should be CapWords style** (e.g., `InsufficientBalance`, `Unauthorized`)

##### 3. Events

- **Event names should be past tense** - Events track things that _happened_
- Using past tense helps avoid naming collisions with structs or functions
- Example: `TokenTransferred` not `TokenTransfer`

##### 4. Mappings

**Prefer named parameters in mapping types** for clarity:

```solidity
// GOOD
mapping(address account => mapping(address asset => uint256 amount)) public balances;

// BAD
mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) public balances;
```

##### 5. Contract Architecture

- **Prefer composition over inheritance** when functions could reasonably be in separate contracts
- **Avoid writing interfaces** unless absolutely necessary - they separate NatSpec from logic
- **Avoid using assembly** unless gas savings are very consequential (>25%)

##### 6. Imports

**Use named imports** and order alphabetically:

```solidity
// GOOD
import {Contract} from "./contract.sol";

// Group imports by external and local
import {Math} from '/solady/Math.sol';

import {MyHelper} from './MyHelper.sol';
```

##### 7. Testing Standards

- **Test file names**: `ContractName.t.sol`
- **Test contract names**: `ContractNameTest` or `FunctionNameTest`
- **Test function names**: `test_functionName_outcome_optionalContext`

### Contract Structure & Organization

#### File Header

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity 0.8.29;
```

#### Contract Layout (in order)

1. License identifier
2. Pragma statements
3. Import statements
4. Contract declaration
5. State variables (grouped by visibility)
6. Events
7. Errors
8. Modifiers
9. Constructor/Initializer
10. External functions
11. Public functions
12. Internal functions
13. Private functions

### Documentation Standards

#### NatSpec Requirements

- **All external functions, events, and errors should have complete NatSpec**
- Minimally include `@notice`
- Include `@param` and `@return` for parameters and return values

**Example formatting:**

```solidity
/// @notice Brief description
///
/// @dev Implementation details
///
/// @param paramName Parameter description
///
/// @return returnValue Return value description
```

#### Struct Documentation

```solidity
/// @notice A struct describing an account's position
struct Position {
    /// @dev The unix timestamp (seconds) when position was created
    uint256 created;
    /// @dev The amount of ETH in the position
    uint256 amount;
}
```

### Security Standards

#### Input Validation

- Validate all inputs at function entry
- Check for zero addresses where applicable
- Validate array lengths and bounds
- Ensure numeric inputs are within expected ranges

#### State Management

- Update state before external calls
- Use reentrancy guards where needed
- Avoid state changes after external calls

#### Access Control

- Use OpenZeppelin's access control patterns (`OwnableUpgradeable`)
- Create custom modifiers for complex authorization logic
- Always validate caller permissions before state changes

### Gas Optimization Guidelines

#### Storage

- Pack struct members efficiently (256-bit boundaries)
- Use mappings over arrays when possible for lookups
- Minimize storage writes
- Use `immutable` and `constant` appropriately

#### Function Optimization

- Use `external` visibility when function won't be called internally
- Batch operations when possible
- Avoid unbounded loops
- Cache array lengths in memory

### Protocol-Specific Patterns

#### Campaign Management

- Use status enums for state machine management
- Implement proper state transition validation
- Track balances and allocations separately for audit clarity

#### Attribution & Rewards

- Validate attribution provider authorization
- Implement overattribution protection
- Use precise fee calculations with basis points

#### ReferralCodeRegistry

- Generate unique identifiers securely
- Implement chain-specific overrides for multi-chain support
- Validate ref code uniqueness

# important-instruction-reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

## Testing Guidelines

- If I am telling you to create tests, and things don't work as expected based on README.md, then always let me know
